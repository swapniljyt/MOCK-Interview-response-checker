Question: Explain the process of Water cycle?
Answer: The water cycle, or hydrological cycle, consists of several stages. Evaporation occurs when
surface water transforms into vapor due to heat. Condensation results in cloud formation as water
vapor cools and condenses into liquid. Precipitation transpires when water droplets or ice crystals
fall from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Runoff entails the surface flow of water back into
oceans, rivers, or lakes.

Question: What is GitHub and why is it used?
Answer: GitHub is a platform for hosting code that allows for version control and collaboration. 
It allows you and others to collaborate on projects from anywhere.
This lesson will teach you the fundamentals of GitHub, such as repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests..

Question:Two resistances are connected in two gaps of Meter Bridge. The balance is 20cm from the zero end.
A resistance of 15 ohms is connected in series with the smaller of the two.
The null point shifts to 40cm. What is the value of the bigger resistance?
Answer:Explanation: Let P be the smaller resistance and Q be the bigger resistance.
First case → P/Q=20/80=1/4
Second case → (P+15)/Q=40/60=2/3
Comparing both → P/(P+15)=1/4×3/2=3/8
8P = 3P + 45 → 5P = 45 → P = 9 ohms
Therefore, substituting in P/Q=1/4 → 9/Q=1/4 → Q = 36 ohms.

Question: Find the roots of the equation y^3 - 23y^2+ 142y -120?
Answer:here are the steps to factorise the equation
       => y^3 - 23y^2+ 142y -120
       => y^3−y^2−22x^2+22x+120x−120
       => y^2(y−1)−22y(y−1)+120(y−1)
       => (y−1){x2−10x−12x+120}
       => (y−1){y(y−10)−12(y−10)}
       => (x−1)(x−10)(x−12)
Question:The resistivity of semiconductors and insulators decreases linearly with the increase of temperature.?
Answer:The resistivity of semiconductors and insulators decreases exponentially with the increase in temperature. 
This is because the number density of free electrons increases exponentially with the increase in temperature.
