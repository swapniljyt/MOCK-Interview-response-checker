Question: Explain the process of Water cycle?
Answer: A Water cycle is a process underwhich H2O has been evoporates from big water bodies like ocean,seas,river .After that the evoporates steams 
make cloud of stream droplets when the cloud got dense then the precipitate in the form of rain,hail and snow this is the water cycle.

Question:Two resistances are connected in two gaps of Meter Bridge. The balance is 20cm from the zero end.
A resistance of 15 ohms is connected in series with the smaller of the two.
The null point shifts to 40cm. What is the value of the bigger resistance?
Answer:Explanation: Let P be the smaller resistance and Q be the bigger resistance.
=> A/B=20/80=1/4
=> (A+15)/B=40/60=2/3
=> A/(A+15)=1/4×3/2=3/8
=> 8A = 3A + 45  
=> 8A-3A = 45 
=> A = 9 ohms
substituting in A/B=1/4 → 9/B=1/4 → B = 36 ohms.

Question: Find the roots of the equation y^3 - 23y^2+ 142y -120?
Answer:
Factors of 120 is = 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-8,-10,-12,-15,-20,-24,-30,-40,-60,
now caliberate these factors such that their summation is = -23 and multiplications is = -120
so the anwer is -1,-10,-12
=> -1 * -10 * -12 = -120
=> -1+(-10)+(-12)=-23
So our roots is (x−1)(x−10)(x−12)
