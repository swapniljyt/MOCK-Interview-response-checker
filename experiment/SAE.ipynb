Evaporation occurs when surface water transforms into vapor due to heat . Condensation results in cloud formation as water vapor cools and condenses into liquid . Precipitation transpires when water droplets or ice crystals fall from clouds as rain , snow , sleet , or hail . Runoff entails the surface flow of water back into oceans , rivers , or lakes .', 'Question : What is GitHub and why is it used ?': 'Answer : GitHub is a platform for hosting code that allows for version control and collaboration .
